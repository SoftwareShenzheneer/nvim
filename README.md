# Neovim config
This is my personal nvim configuration which I use daily. It's a pretty basic setup but just enough to get me through every task I ran into so far.
This should be able to serve for anyone who is looking for a minimal configuration. The components include:
- harpoon - switching between files with the push of a button, currently not in use
- lsp-zero - complete lsp, C, Python, Bash and Lua installed
- markdown-preview - preview markdown files
- nvim-autopairs - auto match brackets
- nvim-cmp
- nvim-telescope - finder
- nvim-tree
- nvim-treesitter
- snippets - code snippets, currently not in use
- theme - for the theme
- vim-be-good - to use motions in a playful environment

It works on my machine.
