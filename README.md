# Neovim config
This is my personal nvim configuration which I use daily. It's a pretty basic setup but just enough to get me through every task I ran into so far.
This should be able to serve for anyone who is looking for a minimal configuration. The components include:
- fzf - fuzzy finder
- lsp-zero - complete lsp, C, Python, Bash and Lua installed
- nvim-autopairs - auto match brackets
- nvim-treesitter
- theme - for the theme
- obsidian - for note taking

It works on my machine.
