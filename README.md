# Neovim config
This is my personal nvim configuration which I use daily. It's a pretty basic setup but just enough to get me through every task I ran into so far.
This should be able to serve for anyone who is looking for a minimal configuration. The components include:
- cmp-buffer
- cmp-nvim-lsp
- cmp-nvim-lua
- cmp-path
- cmp_luasnip
- friendly-snippets
- lazy
- lsp-zero
- Luasnip
- markdown-preview
- mason
- nvim-cmp
- nvim-lspconfig
- nvim-treesitter
- nvim-treesitter-context
- playground
- plenary
- telescope
- tokyonight
- vim-be-good
- nvim-autopairs
- nvim-tree
- nvim-web-devicons

Some of these are double, that is because I attempted to install 2 different version of basic auto complete. Maybe I will clean this up, maybe I won't.

It works on my machine.
